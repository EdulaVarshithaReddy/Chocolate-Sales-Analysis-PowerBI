🛒🍫**Chocolate Sales Analysis — Power BI Dashboard**
📊**Project Overview**
The Chocolate Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of chocolate shipments, sales performance, and profitability across different regions, products, and salespersons.
The objective of this project is to identify sales patterns, evaluate top-performing products and regions, and assess profitability trends to support data-driven business decisions.

🧾**Dataset**
The dataset contains five related tables:
Shipments – Shipment-level transactions and quantities
Products – Product details including name, type, and pack information
People – Salesperson information
Locations – Regional and country details
Calendar – Date dimension table for time-based analysis

⚙️ **Data Modeling and Process**
Data Loading: Imported all five tables into Power BI from Excel.
Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to remove duplicates, fix data types, and handle missing values.
Modeling: Built a star schema model with Shipments as the fact table and Products, People, Locations, and Calendar as dimension tables.
DAX Calculations: Created measures for Total Amount, Total Boxes, Total Profit, Profit %, and Year-over-Year (YoY) metrics.
Optimization: Ensured proper relationships, reduced unnecessary columns, and improved refresh performance.

📈**Dashboard Details**
The dashboard consists of well-structured visuals and interactive filters that allow users to analyze performance across different perspectives.

**Key Visuals:**
CY vs PY Trends: Line charts comparing current and previous year performance for sales amount and total boxes.
Regional Performance: Donut chart showing total amount by geography.
Shipment Distribution: Histogram showing shipment frequency distribution.
Top Salespersons: Table showing the top six performers with total amount, boxes, and profit percentage.
Product Insights: Visuals displaying top products and profitability across different chocolate categories.
Interactive Filters: Date range and slicers for flexible analysis.
